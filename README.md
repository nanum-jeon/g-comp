# Introduction to G-Computation for Causal Inference

This repository contains tutorials that demonstrate how to implement **g-computation** (the g-formula) for estimating causal effects in both **static** (cross-sectional) and **time-varying** (longitudinal) settings. These materials are based on the framework introduced in:

> Naimi, A. I., Cole, S. R., & Kennedy, E. H. (2017).  
> *An introduction to g methods.* International Journal of Epidemiology, 46(2), 756â€“762.

## Contents

### `gformula_static.Rmd`
- Implements the g-formula in a simple cross-sectional setup
- Demonstrates both:
  - **Non-parametric g-computation** (standardization)
  - **Parametric g-computation** (via regression models)
- Includes comparison with unadjusted and stratified estimates

### `gformula_timevarying.Rmd` *(coming soon or included)*
- Introduces a longitudinal setup with time-varying treatments and confounders
- Implements **iterated g-computation**
- Illustrates how to model sequential treatment and outcome processes

## Getting Started

To run the tutorials:

1. Clone the repository or download the `.Rmd` files
2. Open the files in RStudio
3. Run interactively or knit to HTML

Required R packages:
```r
install.packages(c("dplyr", "knitr", "kableExtra"))
